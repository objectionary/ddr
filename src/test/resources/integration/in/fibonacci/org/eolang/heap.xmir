# Emulation of random-access memory (RAM).
[size] &gt; heap

  # Allocates a block in memory of "s" bytes,
  # and returns a pointer to it.
  # The "length" attribute of the pointer won't be bound.
  [s] &gt; malloc /pointer

  # Freed a block in memory, which is referred by the
  # given pointer, which was earlier obtained with malloc().
  # Returns TRUE if works. If the pointer provided wasn't
  # previously allocated, the result will be [].
